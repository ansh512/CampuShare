Campus Goods Sharing System
CampuShare is a web application that allows students and faculty members within a campus community to share goods and services with each other. This application aims to promote sustainability, reduce waste, and foster a sense of community among its users. CampusShare is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) and is designed to be easy to use and visually appealing.
